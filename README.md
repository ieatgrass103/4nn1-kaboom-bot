I would put the original script in this repo but its easier to update if I only keep it in one place. I'll put the script in here eventully and put a loadstring in pastebin when I do

I don't recommend using this script unless you have two devices, one for the bot to run on, and another for your main

The current commands are
;kaboom (plr), ;exterminate (plr), ;dig, ;digf, ;digt, ;spamsounds, ;unspamsounds, ;cmds, ;info (command), ;grabcats (plr), ;getno, ;checkadmin, ;checkblacklist, ;credits

The current commands that can only be run from the bot account, or any account that has admin are
;checkrunning, ;forceleave, ;crash, ;rejoin, ;to (plr), ;explain, ;blacklist (plr), ;whitelist (plr)

If you want to give your main account admin then use the original script which is on pastebin.com/dpbyX8W4 and put your username in the admin table.

Usernames have to be exact and everything is case sensitive. This will be changed eventually.
